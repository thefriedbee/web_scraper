      "I drive to midtown NYC pretty much every day and initially it was amazing but now, it’s the same as it was pre congestion pricing. Traffic is horrible until about 8pm. My parking garage guys have said business is actually up.\n",
      "As much as I believe in congestion pricing, I want to see percentages. I was told early on, never trust anyone who says ‘trust me’\n",
      "No actual figures probably means the percentages are so low they’re embarrassing to publish.  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Traffic is down a whopping .02%, while subway ridership has sharply increased by .01%”.  (Source: the people pocketing the money from the program). \n",
      "Kinda weird that they used this vague information instead of quantifying it but congestion pricing is goated\n",
      "Data is provided by the MTA using guess work. Read the article it clearly states “MTA estimates” on most the bullet points. There is no data provided for people to comb thru.\n",
      "Congestion pricing is working well. No amount of downvotes from right wing trolls will change that\n",
      "The sad part is most of the money will be wasted\n",
      "Of course it's working...no wonder why Trump wants to shut it down!\n",
      "I had to drive to court at 60 Centre Street last week and it took me 50 minutes from White Plains. And I found free, street parking at 11 am a block from the court house without having to pay for one of those hourly garages!\n",
      "Everything about congestion pricing is working. It’s the best new policy of the 21st century.\n",
      "Just another in a long line of taxes against the middle class\n",
      "Convinced me not to go to Manhattan anymore\n",
      "Where is the data??\n",
      "Unfortunately this issue has been politicized.  People who support Trump are unwilling to see the benefits while those who oppose him are unwilling to acknowledge its downsides.  NYT falls under the umbrella of the latter. The decrease in commuters hurts business  that rely on foot traffic. Business that rely on deliveries are getting slammed. Most of all contractors that bid on work to keep the city maintained and build new infrastructure are bidding WAY WAY higher on all manhattan work.  As of right now there are NO exemptions for city contractors and those costs will get passed along to the tax payers.  Material deliveries like concrete charge surcharges, companies are tacking on 15% minimum when bidding any work in manhattan. Think road repair, utility work, sidewalks, tree pruning, HVAC services, water main repair, tree planting, pavement marking, window cleaning, etc etc \n",
      "\n",
      "They need to allow for some exemptions.  For instance there are no concrete or asphalt plants downtown, so any job that requires a big pour of several loads of concrete a day is going to get absolutely demolished in surcharges\n",
      "Working for who?\n",
      "Correlation does not equal causation\n",
      "\n",
      "CP was initiated at the same time there was a huge increase in immigration enforcement. A lot of illegal immigrants stayed off the road for fear of deportation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now please do something about all the school workers driving home, zonked out on gummies, driving 50 MPH in the left lane.\n",
      "My own experience is driving into the city a couple of times a month to get downtown. I used to plan an hour for this, but sometimes that wasn't enough. Since congestion pricing, I plan an hour and it takes me 45 minutes. A couple of times even less. And I've found that the added toll charge makes taking MetroNorth almost as cost efficient (despite it still being way too expensive), so I've reacclimated myself to getting to the train platform on time (I'm within close walking distance, to be honest), so overall, I think congestion pricing is working from my personal perspective, at least.\n",
      "Time to raise the toll and expand the zone\n",
      "I work in analytics and data science. I read the source of information. These numbers are most likely not indicative of the truth. There are some data points that are promising however, these wreak of cherry picked stats:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many metrics use a benchmark of ‘from this month last year’ which is essentially one data point and a very poor benchmark at that. I would’ve most likely have used traffic benchmarks between 2016-19 (earliest consistent period prior to Covid). \n",
      "\n",
      "I also see many statements of ‘based on predictions of X’s best guess’ which is a huge red flag. That indicates that these are based on models and not observations, as someone developing models, they are often manipulated into what the executives want it to see. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further we have data from the direct beneficiary of this program being successful (both the MTA and DOT). This further ties in with my statement just above. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want this program to succeed and for me to be proven wrong, but based on the data publicly available I can’t trust the early results. Even if these results are accurate, if I were working this analysis I would not want to release this study publicly yet due to a high likelihood that it could be the result of a temporary behavioral response to the new pricing, which will return to normal figures over a longer period. I base that prediction on the number of drivers entering the congestion zone steadily month over month as the data shows. I know this issue is politicized, I don’t really care about that but I do care about math. We need a lot more data for the math to check out.\n",
      "Emptier wallets for the not-wealthy…up and up\n",
      "I’m trying to understand how bailing out an agency as money wasting and foolish as the mta is a good thing? Especially by taxing the drivers.\n",
      "Yeah it’s not. I can tell this chart is bullshit because transit ridership is the same. Stop simping for more taxes, they ain’t gonna help you.\n",
      "This proves one thing: A lot of people that didn’t absolutely have to drive into “the zone” were doing it just because they could. Now that it costs money they aren’t clogging up the roads. Especially Fridays.\n",
      "Glad to see they included impact on local businesses.\n",
      "That sounds very biased.\n",
      "Yeah that’s all the benefits, nobody was really arguing those. I think it’s the cost to the drivers that are argued\n",
      "Dirty riff-raff service workers: Down  \n",
      "Subway crowding: Up\n",
      "The subways to work now as a non driver, take me about 50 to 75% longer, and are more uncomfortably packed.\n",

      "Source: trust me bro\n",
      "My own experience, traffic is really bad in the zone but at least it only costs me $9 to sit in it.\n",
      "i dont understand how anyone can oppose this\n",
      "Those of if us who drive know this is absolute nonsense\n",
      "I don’t think much has changed now.  I head down there atleast 2 times a week and I am always stuck in traffic on non peek times at that\n",
      "It’s not working I was stuck last Friday going from Chelsea piers to 42 st took me 1 hour\n",
      "Honestly at least the commute to NJ is cheaper .. still sucks tho\n",
      "I drive into the city for work on Mondays (I work nights, 7 pm to 7:30 a.m.) and the traffic was very quiet when congestion pricing started, but the last few weeks there was traffic at the midtown tunnel. The cars are coming back! \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I drove uptown about 2 months ago and I realized it’s not that traffic is down. It’s just shifted uptown. \n",
      "Can't argue with data like that\n",
      "Drove into the city the other day hoping I wouldn’t be sharing the road with all the less fortunate but congestion pricing hasn’t done anything for the traffic as far as I can tell.\n",
      "We've been screwed when renting a car....we have our own ez pass but the readers go by plate.  We can't  load the rental plate bc it's already on the car rental acct.  So the rental co gets charged full price then we get charged full price plus fees!\n",
      "If the purpose is to lower these stats, the city is better served simply stating that if you dont live on the island of manhattan, you cannot have a vehicle there.  Further more, vastly eliminating the illegal operation of bikes / e-bikes will make the city much much safer.  But we all know thats not what this program is about - this is about money and taking money from those who drive/ride in cars and giving it to those who do not drive/ride in cars\n",
      "Left out increases in payouts to MTA board members.  Up up up. \n",
      "\n",
      "NYC Representatives on the MTA board still NONE NONE NONE.\n",
      "Show specific numbers or else I'm going to assume the difference is only a trivial amount like \"0.01%\". After all, we already had significant tolls on the bridge and tunnels before (crossing the tunnel from New Jersey costs like $30) so is yet another toll really going to matter?\n",
      "Is there actual data or is this just one persons observation\n",
      "Yay let’s pay more taxes, we won!\n",
      "TAX ME MORE HOCHUL, TAX ME MORE BUCKY THE BEAVER!\n",
      "Yes! Paying an additional toll in a vehicle that you’ve paid taxes on (while also annually renewing your registration on a depreciating asset). Driving that vehicle on roads that you pay taxes for to be paved and well-kept (even tho we all know that’s a joke) in a state that taxes 40% of your paycheck 😍😍\n",
      "I’m stunned that traffic noise complaints are even a thing!\n",
      "Duh. If Trump says it's bad, it's going to be good for a lot of people.\n",
      "Any word on the businesses and how they are doing?\n",
      "Every time I’ve gone into the zone my trip has been faster. Finding parking isn’t much different but I mostly see cabs driving around me now\n",
      "Hochel bribes on election years\n",
      "Fortunately I rarely have to drive into the city but I find this data at odds with what I hear on the traffic news every morning. It seems like traffic is still a thing with 30-45 delays still.\n",
      "For who?   This is the land of make believe.  Nothing got better with congestion pricing!!\n",
      "congestion pricing is goated nobody can tell me otherwise\n",
      "It didn't mention city (or state, I don't know who) also received $158M in revenue that can help with infrastructure  projects. \n",

      "  \n",
      "I guess it's deliberately left out because it'll get people thinking - where did those money come from, oh my pocket lol\n",
      "Charging drivers to subsidize the mismanaged MTA: Still wrong\n",
      "No wonder the Trump Administration wanted to kill it.\n",
      "Can we do it in Westchester next?  Ahhhh....\n",

      "That table is absolute shit. Either you have the data, so report the numbers ... or you don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't have the numbers, you know nothing and you should shut up.\n",
      "I wish they would have reached out to contractors hired out by DOT, DDC, Parks dept, etc they are bidding higher on jobs because of this. To bring a fleet in and out of downtown is insanely expensive and there are no exemptions. That cost gets passed on to the tax payers. We are talking 100s of millions of dollars. Cost of maintenance goes up, cost of repairs goes up, cost of building goes up.\n",
      "I love it! Drive into city once a week - I pay the toll and have a much faster, safer drive\n",
      "Mods: This is for wEsTcHesTer NOT tHe CiTy!!!!\n",
      "No surprises here. But I don't like the way it's presented at all. 'Up, up, up' reads like patronizing your audience. It annoyed me, at least.  \n",

      "BS. My commute take 2-3 hours every day to get home to NJ from Queens. Same as it was before.\n",
      "BS. Who came up with this nonsense?\n",

      "Vague results, I’d prefer percentages\n",
      "Its a tax because the mta is beyond corrupt and people r ok with it because the subways are going to be beyond repair very soon.  These r the same people that get excited about a tax refund.\n",
      "Any facts to go with that?\n",
      "WITH THE LATEST: U.S. wholesale prices fell by 0.5% in April, marking the biggest drop in five years, despite DJT's sweeping tariffs on imports.\n",

      "We just parroting shit now\n",
      "Those are useless metrics that only show the benefits without the costs. If we simply blockaded every street and banned cars entirely, that would also reduce cars on the street to zero; but that doesn't mean it would be a good idea. \n",

      "  The whole point of congestion pricing is well-off Manhattan people can afford to pay the tolls so they think it's great their commute is faster since they don't have to share the roads with poor people anymore, so they get only benefits.
