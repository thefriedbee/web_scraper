NYC and SF have barely functioning public transportation systems.

It took a lot of energy to get congestion pricing in NYC. Still lots of space are given to cars in both cities. 

No airport wall/doors to prevent people from falling onto tracks.

Both are failures as cities.

I live in nyc I saw when there was smog here in the 80’s EV’s &hybrids came out solved that problem. Let’s stop w/this pollution thing Congestion Pricing was a money grab by the Inept MTA. Nothing has been proven how it affects the economy. Bikes belong in Parks. Cars r for roads

Roads, like housing, get clogged when treated as "free." NYC’s congestion pricing showed that a simple $9 toll restructured demand, reducing traffic by 5–10% inside the city.

We're hearing that Trump's DOT Secretary Sean Duffy — the guy who's been trying to shut down congestion pricing — is doing a press conference with Mayor Adams: Borough Hall station at 11 a.m.

If you can get there to protest, be ready to boo. NYC isn't going back to more traffic.

Cars are a danger to our society.

We MUST ban all cars from Manhattan, make transit free, and convert ALL travel lanes to bike lanes.

In addition, we should expand congestion pricing to include all of NYC and raise the price to $25.

Make NYC Safe OR Lose All Federal Funding 

The Ultimatum has been giving to NY’s MTA and they will either comply or risk losing BILLIONS in federal funds they receive annually

NY Gov Hochul refuses to end congestion pricing and will most likely not push The MTA to comply

The early #data seem to support the benefits that NYC expected when they introduced #congestion pricing. I particularly appreciate in the study the effort to quantify (even tho not perfectly) the spillover effects on other parts of the city https://nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33584/w33584.pdf… #Transportation

Yes, Trump likened himself to a king on Truth Social last month, celebrating the end of NYC’s congestion pricing program with “LONG LIVE THE KING!” The White House even shared a mock magazine cover of him in a crown. He’s got a thing for royal vibes—gold, parades, you name it.

More on NYC congestion pricing: free flowing traffic means less noise pollution and greater safety for pedestrians. 

(Vehicles have much less a need to get every inch by blocking the box.)

Only a petty tyrant would try to get rid of it without looking at any data. 

Funny how

I am NOT in favor of the NYC congestion pricing as it is, but if you think it’s a tax on the poor, you are misunderstanding. In theory, those below a certain income are to be exempt, and most of the lowest incomes are taking public transportation. That said -they bungled the plan

Absolutely, but the issue is that in New York City we are using congestion pricing as an excuse to charge other working class people that need cars. We can fund the MTA if we tax banks and wealthy corporations. NYC is not Finland. We need cars and many make money from them.

Congestion pricing is actually delivering for NYC’s workers — something Sean Duffy clearly doesn’t get.

Less traffic and faster travel times have led to a 19% increase in taxi fares — their best January since the pandemic. 

And it’s helping other businesses too.

Trump’s USDOT is throwing a tantrum, ordering NYC to shut down congestion pricing by March 21.

But the MTA isn’t budging without a court order! Good. 

Sorry, but what we're not gonna do is take transit advice from a guy whose businesses went bankrupt six times.

Interesting article about NYC congestion pricing.
TLDR: NYC is disregarding the executive order and continuing to price entry. Washington will probably fail in court to overrule New York. But when New York wants DC dollars for other projects things might change:

Not so fast, Trump! 

NYC congestion pricing still a thing - and apparently pretty popular w/the City: 

NYT reporter at a March in NYC to support congestion pricing:

"...one of the times when the classic chant — “whose streets? our streets“ — is not just a metaphor but literal"
The media could not be played.

U.S. DOT made the decision to terminate NY City's congestion pricing plan. Praise from the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, who believe the plan would have unfairly burdened truckers. City has plans to fight the decision. #transportation #congestionpricing #NYC
