Car brain? How about bike brain? Why does a "social" bike ride involve riding the wrong way down a street? Sorry, that's an antisocial bike ride.

Kathy Hochul claimed she put money back in people’s pockets because NY was originally going to charge $15 for congestion pricing and is now only charging $9.

uummmm that’s now how this works… how about no extra driving tax to begin with!

Congestion pricing implemented in NYC today is a misappropriation of public assets by just a few out of touch individuals and is designed to take property not belonging to them for their personal use.

Mind-blowing how effective congestion pricing is. Lower Manhattan streets remain completely empty. It's an important lesson to remember: how price-conscious the typical consumer is - a daily $9 fee changed the entire landscape of NYC. Lower Manhattan is going to really boom now

It is so funny watching the Trump administration keep losing as they try to shut down congestion pricing

Especially because
- Congestion pricing is incredibly effective
- Republicans constantly talk about “states’ rights” (they lie)
- Average people don’t drive into NYC

I understand there's political issues behind Trump's attacks on NYC's congestion pricing scheme, but generally speaking congestion pricing is obviously necessary and positive in every major American city and refusing to adopt it is essentially a societal IQ test.

Congestion pricing has helped transit in NYC more than free fares have helped any city that has implemented them. We should shift the focus to charging traffic/cars and shift toward tolling expressways.

This was a concern when congestion pricing was being contemplated (hence the important investments in air quality improvements in the BX) - but as it turns out this isn’t happening.

Congestion pricing spared Midtown 10 million car trips? Cool story. Most of those ‘avoided’ trips were just rerouted through the Bronx, Queens, and working-class neighborhoods—so Manhattan could get a cosmetic facelift at everyone else’s expense.

First, what is congestion pricing?

It's an added fee sent to drivers when they drive on certain roads, at certain times, in order to dissuade people from using the road when they don't need to.

The initiative aims to cut down on needless overuse, leading to slow roads.
